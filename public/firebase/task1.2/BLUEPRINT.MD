 # Morning Brew Website Blueprint
## Overview
This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for the Morning Brew coffee shop website. The goal is to create a welcoming and informative online presence that attracts new customers and serves existing ones.
## Project Plan
1.  **Homepage First:** Create a single, comprehensive homepage that includes all essential information. **(Completed)**
2.  **Visual Design:** Implement a warm, inviting, and modern design that reflects the "artisanal" and "cozy" brand identity. **(Completed)**
3.  **Content Strategy:** Organize content logically to guide users from discovery to visiting the shop. **(Completed)**
4.  **Mobile-First:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices. **(Completed)**

## Design and Style
*   **Color Palette:** Warm and inviting colors, including coffee-inspired browns (`#6a4f4b`), creamy off-whites (`#f4f1eb`), and clean whites (`#fff`).
*   **Typography:** A friendly, readable font for body text ('Lato') paired with a more distinctive, "artisanal" font for headings ('Playfair Display').
*   **Imagery:** High-quality, appealing photos of coffee, pastries, and the cafe's interior. Placeholder images are currently in use.
*   **Texture:** A subtle noise texture (`subtle-white-feathers.png`) is applied to the main background for a premium, tactile feel.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows on menu items create a sense of depth, making them look "lifted" from the page.
*   **Overall Vibe:** Cozy, welcoming, clean, and modern, with a focus on quality and community.

## Homepage Sections
1.  **Header:** A simple header with the "Morning Brew" name and navigation links.
2.  **Hero Section:** A prominent, full-width image with a welcoming tagline and a semi-transparent overlay to ensure text readability.
3.  **About Us:** A brief section to share the story of Morning Brew and its connection to the community.
4.  **Our Menu:** A simple, elegant showcase of popular menu items, each with a title and description, presented in a card-based layout.
5.  **Visit Us:** Clear and concise information on location and opening hours.
6.  **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright information.
## Interactivity
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** The navigation links smoothly scroll the user to the corresponding section of the page.

Prompt:
I'm launching 'FitCore Studio,' a boutique fitness center offering yoga, pilates, and strength training classes. We have 6 certified trainers, offer both group classes and personal training, and pride ourselves on creating a non-intimidating environment for all fitness levels. Our website needs to serve multiple purposes: showcase our class schedule, introduce our trainers, explain our philosophy, and convert visitors into members. Please design our homepage and explain your strategy for organizing these different content areas. How will you help potential members understand what makes us different from big gym chains?
Please follow these constraints strictly:
Use ONLY HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks, libraries, or external dependencies)
Do NOT use web search or any external tools
