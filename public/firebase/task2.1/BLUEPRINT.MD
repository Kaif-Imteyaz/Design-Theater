# Essence Jewelry - Project Blueprint


## Overview


This project is the homepage for "Essence Jewelry," a minimalist jewelry brand. The goal is to create a clean, modern, and sophisticated web presence that reflects the brand's values of timeless elegance, quality craftsmanship, and ethical sourcing. The target audience is professional women aged 25-40 who appreciate minimalist design and sustainable luxury.


## Design and Features


This section documents the visual design choices and features implemented for the Essence Jewelry homepage.


### Visual Design


The visual design is guided by Scandinavian design principles—minimalism, simplicity, and functionality. The aim is to create a user experience that is calm, sophisticated, and focused.


*   **Color Palette:** The palette is intentionally restrained to create a feeling of elegance and serenity.
    *   **Background:** A soft, off-white (`#FAF9F6`) provides a warm and inviting base, avoiding the clinical feel of pure white.
    *   **Text:** A dark charcoal (`#2d2d2d`) is used for text. It's softer than pure black, making it easier on the eyes while maintaining high readability.
    *   **Accent:** A muted gold (`#C0B283`) serves as the primary accent color. It is used for calls-to-action and subtle highlights, alluding to the precious metals of the jewelry without being overly ostentatious.


*   **Typography:** The typography pairing creates a balance between classic elegance and modern clarity.
    *   **Headings:** `Georgia`, a classic serif font, is used for all headings. Its timeless feel is enhanced with increased letter-spacing (`letter-spacing: 1.5px`) and a lighter font-weight, giving it a more modern and airy quality.
    *   **Body Text:** `Arial`, a clean and highly legible sans-serif font, is used for paragraphs and navigation links. This ensures that detailed information is easy to read and complements the more decorative headings.


*   **Spacing:** Generous whitespace is a cornerstone of the design. Ample margins and padding are used around all elements (text blocks, images, sections) to let the content breathe. This reduces visual clutter, guides the user's eye, and reinforces the minimalist aesthetic. A consistent spacing scale based on `rem` units is used for harmony.


*   **Imagery:** While placeholder images are used for this initial build, the design intends for high-quality, professional photography.
    *   **Style:** Images should be brightly lit with soft, natural light. Backgrounds should be minimal and out of focus to draw full attention to the jewelry.
    *   **Content:** Close-up shots of the jewelry, both on models and as still-life, will highlight the craftsmanship and fine details. The models should reflect the target demographic.


### Implemented Features


*   **Responsive Layout:** The site uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure a fully responsive experience that looks polished on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Subtle Animations:** A gentle fade-in effect is applied to sections as they are scrolled into view, adding a touch of modern dynamism without distracting from the content.


## Current Plan


1.  **DONE** - Create the `blueprint.md` file to establish project goals and design principles.
2.  **NEXT** - Create the `index.html` file with the core structure of the homepage.
3.  Create the `style.css` file to implement the visual design.
4.  Create the `main.js` file to add subtle interactivity.
