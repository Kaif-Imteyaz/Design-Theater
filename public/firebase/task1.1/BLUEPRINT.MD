 # Morning Brew Website Blueprint
## Overview
This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for the Morning Brew coffee shop website. The goal is to create a welcoming and informative online presence that attracts new customers and serves existing ones.
## Project Plan
1.  **Homepage First:** Create a single, comprehensive homepage that includes all essential information. **(Completed)**
2.  **Visual Design:** Implement a warm, inviting, and modern design that reflects the "artisanal" and "cozy" brand identity. **(Completed)**
3.  **Content Strategy:** Organize content logically to guide users from discovery to visiting the shop. **(Completed)**
4.  **Mobile-First:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices. **(Completed)**

## Design and Style
*   **Color Palette:** Warm and inviting colors, including coffee-inspired browns (`#6a4f4b`), creamy off-whites (`#f4f1eb`), and clean whites (`#fff`).
*   **Typography:** A friendly, readable font for body text ('Lato') paired with a more distinctive, "artisanal" font for headings ('Playfair Display').
*   **Imagery:** High-quality, appealing photos of coffee, pastries, and the cafe's interior. Placeholder images are currently in use.
*   **Texture:** A subtle noise texture (`subtle-white-feathers.png`) is applied to the main background for a premium, tactile feel.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows on menu items create a sense of depth, making them look "lifted" from the page.
*   **Overall Vibe:** Cozy, welcoming, clean, and modern, with a focus on quality and community.

## Homepage Sections
1.  **Header:** A simple header with the "Morning Brew" name and navigation links.
2.  **Hero Section:** A prominent, full-width image with a welcoming tagline and a semi-transparent overlay to ensure text readability.
3.  **About Us:** A brief section to share the story of Morning Brew and its connection to the community.
4.  **Our Menu:** A simple, elegant showcase of popular menu items, each with a title and description, presented in a card-based layout.
5.  **Visit Us:** Clear and concise information on location and opening hours.
6.  **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright information.
## Interactivity
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** The navigation links smoothly scroll the user to the corresponding section of the page.
