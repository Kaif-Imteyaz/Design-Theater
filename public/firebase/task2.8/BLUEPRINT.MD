# CreditBuilder App Blueprint


## Overview


CreditBuilder is a web application designed to help users with poor credit scores improve their financial health. The app provides tools and resources to track credit scores, understand credit reports, and build positive credit history. The target audience includes individuals who have been rejected by traditional banks, feel stressed about their financial situation, and may have limited financial literacy.


## Design and Features


### Visual Strategy


The visual design of CreditBuilder aims to create a supportive, trustworthy, and accessible experience for users facing financial and emotional challenges.


*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** A soft blue (`#4A90E2`) to evoke trust and stability.
    *   **Secondary:** A gentle green (`#50E3C2`) to represent growth and financial health.
    *   **Accent:** A warm coral (`#F5A623`) for calls-to-action, providing a sense of optimism.
    *   **Neutral:** Light grays and off-whites for backgrounds to create a clean and calming feel.


*   **Typography:**
    *   **Font:** A clean, modern, and highly legible sans-serif font like 'Lato' or 'Nunito Sans' will be used. These fonts are easy to read on small screens and at various sizes.
    *   **Hierarchy:** Clear and consistent typographic hierarchy will be used to guide the user's attention. Larger font sizes for headings and key information will make the content easy to scan.


*   **Iconography:**
    *   Simple, universally understood icons will be used to supplement text and improve comprehension for users with varying literacy levels. The icons will be friendly and approachable in style.


*   **Layout:**
    *   A mobile-first, single-column layout will be used to ensure a seamless experience on older Android phones with small screens.
    *   Ample white space will be used to reduce cognitive load and prevent the user from feeling overwhelmed.


*   **Imagery:**
    *   Friendly and inclusive illustrations will be used instead of stock photos. The illustrations will depict concepts like growth, progress, and support in a gentle and encouraging manner.


*   **Tone of Voice:**
    *   The language used throughout the app will be simple, encouraging, and empowering. Financial jargon will be avoided, and complex information will be broken down into easily digestible pieces.


### Features


*   **Credit Score Dashboard:** A clear and simple display of the user's credit score.
*   **Score Insights:** Easy-to-understand explanations of the factors affecting the user's credit score.
*   **Goal Setting:** Tools to help users set and track financial goals.
*   **Privacy Mode:** A feature to hide sensitive information, allowing users to check the app discreetly in public.
