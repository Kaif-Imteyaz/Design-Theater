# Project Blueprint: Bella Vista Restaurant Homepage & Reservation System


## 1. Project Overview & Capabilities:


*   **Purpose:** To create a visually stunning and highly functional website for the "Bella Vista" restaurant. The site will serve as a digital storefront, providing essential information and a seamless online reservation system.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Homepage:** A welcoming page that introduces the restaurant, its ambiance, and menu highlights.
    *   **Reservation System:** An intuitive, multi-step booking process that allows customers to reserve a table for a specific date, time, and party size.
    *   **Admin View:** A simple, password-protected area for restaurant staff to view and manage all reservations.


## 2. Design and Features (Initial Version):


*   **Visual Design:**
    *   **Aesthetics:** The design will be clean, elegant, and timeless, using a palette of deep blues, gold, and white to evoke a sense of luxury.
    *   **Typography:** We'll use a classic serif font for headings to convey tradition and a clean sans-serif for body text for readability.
    *   **Imagery:** High-quality, evocative images of the restaurant's interior, dishes, and the "Bella Vista" view will be used.
*   **Homepage Structure:**
    *   **Header:** A fixed header will contain the restaurant's logo, navigation links (Home, Menu, Reservations, Contact), and a "Book a Table" call-to-action button.
    *   **Hero Section:** A full-screen image of the restaurant's best view with the tagline, "Experience a taste of Italy, with a view to remember."
    *   **About Section:** A brief story of the restaurant, its philosophy, and the chef.
    *   **Menu Highlights:** A curated selection of signature dishes, beautifully presented.
    *   **Reservation Section:** The reservation form will be prominently displayed.
    *   **Footer:** Will include contact information, address, hours of operation, and social media links.
*   **Reservation Flow:**
    1.  **Selection:** The user will select the date, time, and party size. The system will provide real-time feedback on availability.
    2.  **Information:** The user will enter their name, email, and phone number.
    3.  **Confirmation:** A summary of the reservation is displayed. Upon confirmation, the user sees a success message.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **HTML:** Semantic HTML5 for structure and accessibility.
    *   **CSS:** Modern CSS with Custom Properties, and a mobile-first responsive design.
    *   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and reservation logic. Web Components will be used to create the reservation form.


## 3. Current Task: Initial Setup and Homepage


*   **Plan:**
    1.  Create the initial HTML structure for the homepage (`index.html`).
    2.  Create the CSS file (`style.css`) with the basic styling, including the color palette, fonts, and layout.
    3.  Create the JavaScript file (`main.js`) to handle any initial dynamic behavior.
    4.  Write a `blueprint.md` file to document the project.
