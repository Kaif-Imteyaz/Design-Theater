    *   **Background (Neutral):** Warm Off-White (`#F7F5F2`)
    *   **Text (Readable):** Dark Warm Gray (`#4E4E4E`)
*   **Typography**:

    *   **Body Text:** System UI sans-serif font for clarity and readability.
*   **Layout**:
    *   Clean, single-column, responsive design.
    *   Generous white space to create a calm, uncluttered feel.
    *   A subtle noise texture on the main background for a tactile, premium feel.
*   **Visual Effects**:

## Current Plan


The current plan is to build the initial version of the homepage based on the design and features outlined above.


**Steps:**
1.  **Structure the `index.html` file** with semantic HTML.
2.  **Style the page using `style.css`**, implementing the color palette, typography, layout, and visual effects.
3.  **Add minimal `main.js`** for any future interactive elements, like smooth scrolling.
4.  **Ensure the design is fully responsive** and accessible.
