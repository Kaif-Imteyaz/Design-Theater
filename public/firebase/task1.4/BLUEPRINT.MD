# Riverside University Homepage Modernization

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for redesigning the Riverside University homepage to effectively serve its diverse audiences while maintaining a cohesive brand identity. The new design will leverage modern web technologies to create a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing experience.

## Strategy

The core of the strategy is to create a personalized experience for each user group through audience-based navigation and content delivery. This will be achieved by:

1.  **Audience-Centric Navigation:** A prominent section on the homepage will allow users to self-identify (e.g., "Prospective Student," "Current Student").
2.  **Dynamic Content:** Based on the user's selection, the homepage will dynamically display relevant information and links.
3.  **Web Components:** Reusable Web Components will be used to build modular content blocks, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
4.  **Modern Design:** The visual design will be clean, professional, and on-brand, utilizing modern CSS for a responsive and engaging layout.

## Implemented Features

*   **Initial Structure:** Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files have been created.
*   **Audience Gateway:** A primary navigation bar has been created to segment the user journey from the very beginning.

## Current Plan

The current development sprint focuses on building out the initial homepage structure and implementing the audience-selection functionality.

1.  **Create the `index.html` structure:** Define the main sections of the homepage, including the header, audience navigation, and content areas.
2.  **Style the homepage with `style.css`:** Apply a modern design with a professional color scheme, responsive layout, and subtle visual enhancements.
3.  **Implement the audience selection logic in `main.js`:** Create the initial Web Components and the JavaScript logic to show/hide content based on the selected audience.
