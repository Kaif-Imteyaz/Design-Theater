# SkillBridge Platform Blueprint


## Overview


SkillBridge is a peer-to-peer learning and mentorship platform designed to connect professionals at all stages of their careers. It facilitates both structured learning through courses and organic knowledge sharing through mentorship and community features.


## Design & Features


### General


*   **Responsive Design:** The platform will be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards will be a priority, ensuring the platform is usable for everyone.
*   **Branding:** The visual identity will be professional yet approachable, avoiding a "corporate" feel. The color palette will be based on shades of blue, with a clean and modern sans-serif font.


### Homepage


*   **Hero Section:** A compelling headline and a brief introductory paragraph will communicate the platform's value proposition. A call-to-action (CTA) button will encourage users to sign up.
*   **"How It Works" Section:** A step-by-step guide will explain how users can benefit from the platform, highlighting the dual role of learner and mentor.
*   **Featured Mentors/Courses:** A dynamic section will showcase popular mentors and courses, allowing for serendipitous discovery.
*   **Testimonials:** Social proof will be provided through testimonials from satisfied users.
*   **Community Section:**  This section will highlight the community aspect of the platform, with links to forums and upcoming virtual meetups.
*   **Footer:** The footer will contain links to important pages like "About Us," "Contact," "Privacy Policy," and "Terms of Service."


### Core Platform Features


*   **User Profiles:** Users will have detailed profiles where they can showcase their skills, experience, and learning goals. Privacy settings will allow users to control what information is visible to others.
*   **Course Creation & Enrollment:** Members can create and enroll in courses. Progress tracking and peer reviews will be integrated.
*   **Mentorship Matching:** A search and filtering system will help users find relevant mentors. Users will also be able to request mentorship.
*   **Discussion Forums:**  Forums will be organized by topic, allowing for asynchronous knowledge sharing.
*   **Virtual Meetups:** The platform will facilitate the scheduling and hosting of virtual meetups.


## Functional Approach


### Structured Learning


*   **Course Marketplace:** A centralized marketplace will allow users to browse and enroll in courses. Courses will be reviewed by peers to ensure quality.
*   **Learning Paths:**  Users can create and follow learning paths, which are curated sequences of courses and mentorship sessions.


### Organic Knowledge Sharing


*   **Community Hub:** A central hub will aggregate content from forums, meetups, and user-generated articles.
*   **Serendipity Engine:** The platform will use a recommendation engine to suggest relevant mentors, courses, and content based on a user's interests and activity.


### User Control & Privacy


*   **Granular Privacy Settings:** Users will have fine-grained control over their profile visibility and data sharing.
*   **Anonymous Mode:** A "stealth mode" will allow users to browse the platform without revealing their identity.


## Current Plan


*   Create the homepage for the SkillBridge platform.
*   Implement the hero section with a clear value proposition.
*   Add "How It Works" and "Featured Mentors" sections.
*   Style the page using modern CSS, ensuring a responsive and accessible design.
*   Use Web Components for reusable UI elements.
