# RebelRoots Landing Page Blueprint


## Overview


This document outlines the plan for creating a bold and disruptive homepage for RebelRoots, a plant-based food startup. The goal is to create a design that reflects the brand's "punk rock" personality while maintaining credibility for both consumers and retailers.


## Visual Strategy


### 1. Color Palette: Vibrant & Edgy


-   **Primary:** Electric Green (`#00FF00`), Punk Pink (`#FF007F`)
-   **Secondary:** Bright Yellow (`#FFFF00`)
-   **Base:** Deep Charcoal Gray (`#1E1E1E`)
-   **Text:** White (`#FFFFFF`) for readability on the dark background.


This high-contrast palette will make the brand feel energetic and rebellious, standing out from the muted, earthy tones of competitors.


### 2. Typography: Bold & Expressive


-   **Headlines:** A bold, geometric sans-serif font (e.g., 'Montserrat' or a similar Google Font) to grab attention and convey confidence.
-   **Body Copy:** A clean and highly readable sans-serif font (e.g., 'Lato' or 'Roboto') to ensure the messaging is clear and trustworthy.


The contrast between the expressive headlines and clean body copy will balance the brand's rebellious spirit with a professional foundation.


### 3. Imagery: Dynamic & Authentic


-   **Style:** Instead of sterile product shots, the imagery will be vibrant, close-up, and slightly messy to emphasize flavor and satisfaction. Think "food truck" or "street food" photography.
-   **Content:** Close-ups of juicy plant-based burgers, loaded hot dogs, and other indulgent-looking meals. The focus is on desire, not just health.


### 4. Layout & Graphics: Energetic & Asymmetrical


-   **Layout:** An asymmetrical layout will create a sense of dynamism and rebellion, breaking free from the rigid, corporate grids of competitors.
-   **Graphics:** Subtle, hand-drawn or graffiti-style accents (like underlines or circles around key words) will be used to add a touch of punk-rock attitude without sacrificing clarity.


### 5. Interactivity: Subtle & Modern


-   **Hover Effects:** Product images will have a subtle zoom or color-shift effect on hover to engage users.
-   **Animations:** Entrance animations on sections will add to the dynamic feel of the page.


## Credibility & Trust


To ensure retailers and consumers see RebelRoots as a credible brand, the design will incorporate:


-   **Clear Navigation:** A simple and intuitive navigation bar.
-   **Professional Copywriting:** The tone will be confident and fun, but the information about products will be clear, concise, and transparent.
-   **Responsive Design:** The site will be fully responsive and accessible on all devices.
-   **Trust Signals:** A dedicated section for "Our Story" or "Our Mission" to build a connection with users, and clear contact information.
