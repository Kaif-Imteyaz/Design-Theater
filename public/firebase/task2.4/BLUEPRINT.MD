# Luxe Verde Homepage Blueprint


## Overview


This document outlines the design and development plan for the Luxe Verde homepage. The goal is to create a visually compelling and on-brand experience that balances luxury and sustainability, targeting affluent, eco-conscious consumers. The design will be implemented using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern web standards.


## Project Outline


### Style and Design


*   **Aesthetics:** Minimalist, sophisticated, and clean. The design will feel exclusive and premium.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Primary: Off-white (`#FDFDFD`), Charcoal (`#222222`).
    *   Accent: Deep, muted green (`#2E3A30`), Gold (`#D4AF37`).
*   **Typography:**
    *   Headings: A classic, elegant serif font (e.g., Playfair Display).
    *   Body: A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Work Sans).
*   **Layout:**
    *   Spacious and uncluttered with generous use of white space.
    *   Asymmetrical layouts for a modern, editorial feel.
    *   Mobile-responsive design.
*   **Imagery:**
    *   High-quality, artistic, and abstract photography.
    *   Placeholders will be used initially, representing textures of fabric and nature.
*   **Effects:**
    *   Subtle noise texture on the main background for a tactile feel.
    *   Multi-layered drop shadows on interactive elements for depth.
    *   Gentle fade-in animations on scroll.


### Features


*   **Header:** Contains the "Luxe Verde" logo and a minimalist navigation menu.
*   **Hero Section:** A full-screen section with a powerful headline and a captivating background image.
*   **Brand Story Section:** A section that communicates the brand's dual mission of luxury and sustainability.
*   **Product Showcase:** A curated display of garments, with high-quality images and minimal text.
*   **Sustainability Section:** Details on the recycled and organic materials used.
*   **Footer:** Links to social media and contact information.
*   **Web Components:** The project will utilize Web Components for creating reusable UI elements like buttons or product cards.
